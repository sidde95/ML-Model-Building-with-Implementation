# ML-Model-Building-Implementation(Kaggle Competitions)

This repository serves as a comprehensive hub for Machine Learning model development, encompassing an array of methodologies spanning Regression, Classification, and Clustering problems. 

Through detailed analysis, it systematically compares and evaluates multiple models to identify the most effective solution tailored to the specific problem domain. Emphasizing the adherence to standard performance metrics like R-Squared for Regression, ROC-AUC for Classification, and other relevant measures, the repository aids in selecting the most optimal model. 

Post identification, the chosen model is thoroughly implemented on test data which are provided in Kaggle-Competitions.
